Name: OpenScap RightLink 10.6.0 Linux Base
Description: |
  Base ServerTemplate for RightLink10. RightLink10 is a new agent to connect
  servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight and simple to
  install. _It is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink v6 or prior
  versions._ See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.

  This base ST includes a few boot scripts that:

  * Wait for an EIP to settle (AWS only)
  * Sets up a valid hostname
  * Configures NTP if not configured
  * Enables RightScale OS monitoring
  * Sets up RightLink10 automatic upgrades
  * Enables Docker support

  It has an operational script to force a RightLink10 upgrade. And we also
  provide a decommission script that provides the reason for shutdown. The
  source of the scripts on this ServerTemplate is available at
  [https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.6.0](https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.6.0).

  Description: Raise an alert if the instance enters the stranded state.
  Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs instance not responding
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance fails to send monitoring information
    for 5 minutes.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu busy
